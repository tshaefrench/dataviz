       "      <td>The University of Central Florida’s (UCF) Faculty Cluster Initiative leverages our existing strengths and fosters the development of strong, interdisciplinary teams focused on solving today’s toughest scientific and societal challenges through teaching and research. As one of America’s largest and most innovative universities, we encourage you to learn more about the Faculty Cluster Initiative at https://www.ucf.edu/faculty/faculty-research-clusters/.  In support of this effort, we are recruiting faculty in the Learning Sciences with a special interest in the nexus of human learning and machine learning (http://ucflearningsciences.org). The Learning Sciences cluster is a partnership between the College of Education and Human Performance and the College of Engineering and Computer Science and will evolve to include all UCF units as well as local K-12 school and area two-year colleges.  The successful candidates will join a large team focused on the integration of transdisciplinary knowledge regarding ways in which big data can inform machine learning algorithms to create more effective personalized learning environments for students of all ages and abilities. Specifically we seek to understand how systems (e.g., users, tools, data, analysis, visualization), interfaces (e.g., natural language, speech, vocalization, vision, gesture, agents, robotics), and cognition (e.g., memory, emotion, curiosity, pattern-recognition, problem solving, decision making), interact in ways that improve students’ academic, behavioral, and social outcomes through personalized learning (e.g., recommendation systems, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, self- and guided-reflection, growth curves, learning pathways, reinforcement, remediation). A broad range of perspectives and research paradigms are used to conduct basic and applied research relative to cognition; the nature of learning; physical, social, and cultural context; learning environments, instructional materials, and systems; the conditions impacting memory, thinking, reflection, problem solving and performance in novice to expert learners; the ways knowledge is represented through machine learning, artificial intelligence, and knowledge engineering; and learner analytics generating meaningful data about student performance, accomplishment, and optimal pathways through knowledge bases and curricula that improve efficacy and reduce time.  Four positions are available. We plan to hire three tenure-track assistant professors and one tenured associate or full professor. Assistant professor candidates must be able to effectively facilitate new and existing research collaborations and have strong potential to secure extramural funding. Senior faculty candidates must also have a proven record of research funding and high impact publications, and demonstrate a strategic vision for how interdisciplinary research and development has the potential to transform learning as we gain new understanding about how humans learn and how machines learn. We anticipate that the successful candidates will have broad interests in learning, research, development, and innovation that span age/grade levels and content domains.  We seek candidates with expertise in any of the following areas: learning standards, curriculum, instruction (PreK – 20), performance assessment, gaming, learning analytics;cognition, learning theory, interface design, user testing, personalized learning;systems for gathering big data, data mining methodologies, recommendation algorithms, data visualization; andknowledge representation, supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, decision making, complex systems, signal processing, parallel and cloud computation, natural language processing, robotics, speech, vision.  Given our interests in collaboration and innovation, each candidate is advised that the on-campus interview process will involve a group interview that will engage finalists for the position. Applications are being evaluated on a rolling basis and interview dates will be communicated to invited candidates at the earliest possible time to coordinate travel.  The successful candidates will be expected to strengthen both the cluster and their chosen tenure home department; successful candidates will be able to choose a tenure home and are encouraged to seek secondary appointments with other units where appropriate. Startup support will be provided with each position. We enthusiastically look forward to the start date for each position on August 8, 2019.

       "189   We seek candidates whose research applies data science methodology and advanced quantitative methods to the study of public policy. The area of research specialty is open, but we will give preference to candidates with interest in collaborating with faculty in a newly developing security and justice policy research cluster, broadly defined. Candidates should have a record of research that utilizes advanced quantitative methods (e.g. causal inference, time series analysis, hierarchical modeling, simulations) and data science skills (e.g. data visualization, machine learning, computational modeling, natural language processing, network science) and be prepared to teach in graduate courses in these areas. Required qualifications include the following: (1) a Ph.D. in Public Policy or a closely related social science or data science discipline; (2) a strong record, appropriate to rank, of high quality peer-reviewed publications related to public policy; (3) a program of research likely to generate publications and extramural funding; (4) teaching experience, appropriate to rank; and (5) a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion as values in the program and college. Candidates at the Associate level should possess credentials and experience appropriate for a tenured associate professorship at UNC Charlotte. A track record of extramural funding is required for candidates at the associate professor rank. Applicants must submit a statement on diversity and inclusion and finalists will be asked during their screening interview how diversity and inclusion are incorporated into their teaching, service, and research. >>Minimum Qualifications: >>Position Number: 004161 >>Posting Date: 11/05/2018 >>Closing Date: >>American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act Funded:>>>>

       "886   The University of Central Florida’s (UCF) Faculty Cluster Initiative leverages our existing strengths and fosters the development of strong, interdisciplinary teams focused on solving today’s toughest scientific and societal challenges through teaching and research. As one of America’s largest and most innovative universities, we encourage you to learn more about the Faculty Cluster Initiative at https://www.ucf.edu/faculty/faculty-research-clusters/.  In support of this effort, we are recruiting faculty in the Learning Sciences with a special interest in the nexus of human learning and machine learning (http://ucflearningsciences.org). The Learning Sciences cluster is a partnership between the College of Education and Human Performance and the College of Engineering and Computer Science and will evolve to include all UCF units as well as local K-12 school and area two-year colleges.  The successful candidates will join a large team focused on the integration of transdisciplinary knowledge regarding ways in which big data can inform machine learning algorithms to create more effective personalized learning environments for students of all ages and abilities. Specifically we seek to understand how systems (e.g., users, tools, data, analysis, visualization), interfaces (e.g., natural language, speech, vocalization, vision, gesture, agents, robotics), and cognition (e.g., memory, emotion, curiosity, pattern-recognition, problem solving, decision making), interact in ways that improve students’ academic, behavioral, and social outcomes through personalized learning (e.g., recommendation systems, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, self- and guided-reflection, growth curves, learning pathways, reinforcement, remediation). A broad range of perspectives and research paradigms are used to conduct basic and applied research relative to cognition; the nature of learning; physical, social, and cultural context; learning environments, instructional materials, and systems; the conditions impacting memory, thinking, reflection, problem solving and performance in novice to expert learners; the ways knowledge is represented through machine learning, artificial intelligence, and knowledge engineering; and learner analytics generating meaningful data about student performance, accomplishment, and optimal pathways through knowledge bases and curricula that improve efficacy and reduce time.  Four positions are available. We plan to hire three tenure-track assistant professors and one tenured associate or full professor. Assistant professor candidates must be able to effectively facilitate new and existing research collaborations and have strong potential to secure extramural funding. Senior faculty candidates must also have a proven record of research funding and high impact publications, and demonstrate a strategic vision for how interdisciplinary research and development has the potential to transform learning as we gain new understanding about how humans learn and how machines learn. We anticipate that the successful candidates will have broad interests in learning, research, development, and innovation that span age/grade levels and content domains.  We seek candidates with expertise in any of the following areas: learning standards, curriculum, instruction (PreK – 20), performance assessment, gaming, learning analytics;cognition, learning theory, interface design, user testing, personalized learning;systems for gathering big data, data mining methodologies, recommendation algorithms, data visualization; andknowledge representation, supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, decision making, complex systems, signal processing, parallel and cloud computation, natural language processing, robotics, speech, vision.  Given our interests in collaboration and innovation, each candidate is advised that the on-campus interview process will involve a group interview that will engage finalists for the position. Applications are being evaluated on a rolling basis and interview dates will be communicated to invited candidates at the earliest possible time to coordinate travel.  The successful candidates will be expected to strengthen both the cluster and their chosen tenure home department; successful candidates will be able to choose a tenure home and are encouraged to seek secondary appointments with other units where appropriate. Startup support will be provided with each position. We enthusiastically look forward to the start date for each position on August 8, 2019.  UCF is one of the nation’s largest universities with a diverse student body of more than 66,000 students and has grown substantially in size, quality, diversity, and reputation in its first 50 years.

       "      <td>The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Berkeley Lab seeks highly motivated postdocs to join the NERSC Exascale Science Application Program (NESAP). NESAP postdocs collaborate with scientific teams to enable the solution of deep, meaningful problems across all program areas funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science. Berkeley Lab addresses the world’s most urgent scientific challenges by advancing sustainable energy, protecting human health, creating new materials, and revealing the origin and fate of the universe. Founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab’s scientific expertise has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes. The University of California manages Berkeley Lab for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. NERSC provides world-class supercomputing, high performance, scalable data systems and services to 7000 users across more than 600 projects running 800 different codes. NERSC’s science impact is acknowledged by over 2000 publications per year. The Challenge: Enabling simulation of complex physical systems, advanced data analytics, and machine learning at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. Successful candidates will join different teams to focus on one of the following frontiers: NESAP for Simulations (N4S): Cutting-edge simulation of complex physical phenomena requires increasing amounts of computational resources due to factors such increasing model sizes, parameter space searches, and inclusion of additional physics. N4S enables simulations to make effective use of modern high-performance computing (HPC) platforms by focusing on algorithm and data structure development and implementation on new architectures such as GPUs, exposing additional parallelism and improving scalability. NESAP for Data (N4D): To answer today’s most complex experimental challenges, scientists are collecting exponentially more data and analyzing it with new computationally intensive algorithms. N4D addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics. NESAP for Learning (N4L): Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are powerful approaches to solving complicated classification, regression, and pattern recognition problems. N4L focuses on developing and implementing cutting-edge ML/DL solutions to improve scientific discovery potential on experimental or simulation data or improving HPC applications by replacing parts of the software stack or algorithms with ML/DL solutions. To enable new discoveries through simulation, data analytics, and ML/DL, NERSC will begin deploying “Perlmutter,” a Cray supercomputer, in 2020. Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, is a heterogeneous system including future-generation AMD CPUs and next-generation NVIDIA GPUs. It also has a high-speed interconnect and an all-flash file system. Perlmutter is NERSC’s first production GPU-based system. Many codes running at NERSC need to be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs. At the same time, solutions that put GPU performance in users’ hands need to be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computer science and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge. As a NESAP Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC. You will carry out code transition efforts in collaboration with a project PI and team members with the support of NERSC and vendor staff. Successful candidates are expected to collaborate with each other across NESAP program areas (N4S, N4D, N4L). NESAP has established a track record of enabling its postdocs to pursue careers in data science, HPC, and scientific computing both in industry and at national labs. Take a look at what current and former NESAP postdocs are up to here. Specific Responsibilities: Successful candidates will have one or more of the following responsibilities: Work with NERSC staff and code teams to transition and optimize simulation, data analytics, or machine learning codes for the Perlmutter system in performance-portable ways. Conduct profiling and scaling studies as well as parallelization, memory bandwidth, and I/O analyses for these codes; identify and capitalize on NERSC’s combined HPC/data ecosystems. Working with domain experts, develop, adapt, and optimize state-of-the-art ML/DL models to solve scientific problems on HPC systems. All postdocs will have the responsibility to: Disseminate results of research activities through refereed publications, reports, and conference presentations.

       "838   The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Berkeley Lab seeks highly motivated postdocs to join the NERSC Exascale Science Application Program (NESAP). NESAP postdocs collaborate with scientific teams to enable the solution of deep, meaningful problems across all program areas funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science. Berkeley Lab addresses the world’s most urgent scientific challenges by advancing sustainable energy, protecting human health, creating new materials, and revealing the origin and fate of the universe. Founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab’s scientific expertise has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes. The University of California manages Berkeley Lab for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. NERSC provides world-class supercomputing, high performance, scalable data systems and services to 7000 users across more than 600 projects running 800 different codes. NERSC’s science impact is acknowledged by over 2000 publications per year. The Challenge: Enabling simulation of complex physical systems, advanced data analytics, and machine learning at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. Successful candidates will join different teams to focus on one of the following frontiers: NESAP for Simulations (N4S): Cutting-edge simulation of complex physical phenomena requires increasing amounts of computational resources due to factors such increasing model sizes, parameter space searches, and inclusion of additional physics. N4S enables simulations to make effective use of modern high-performance computing (HPC) platforms by focusing on algorithm and data structure development and implementation on new architectures such as GPUs, exposing additional parallelism and improving scalability. NESAP for Data (N4D): To answer today’s most complex experimental challenges, scientists are collecting exponentially more data and analyzing it with new computationally intensive algorithms. N4D addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics. NESAP for Learning (N4L): Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are powerful approaches to solving complicated classification, regression, and pattern recognition problems. N4L focuses on developing and implementing cutting-edge ML/DL solutions to improve scientific discovery potential on experimental or simulation data or improving HPC applications by replacing parts of the software stack or algorithms with ML/DL solutions. To enable new discoveries through simulation, data analytics, and ML/DL, NERSC will begin deploying “Perlmutter,” a Cray supercomputer, in 2020. Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, is a heterogeneous system including future-generation AMD CPUs and next-generation NVIDIA GPUs. It also has a high-speed interconnect and an all-flash file system. Perlmutter is NERSC’s first production GPU-based system. Many codes running at NERSC need to be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs. At the same time, solutions that put GPU performance in users’ hands need to be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computer science and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge. As a NESAP Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC. You will carry out code transition efforts in collaboration with a project PI and team members with the support of NERSC and vendor staff. Successful candidates are expected to collaborate with each other across NESAP program areas (N4S, N4D, N4L). NESAP has established a track record of enabling its postdocs to pursue careers in data science, HPC, and scientific computing both in industry and at national labs. Take a look at what current and former NESAP postdocs are up to here. Specific Responsibilities: Successful candidates will have one or more of the following responsibilities: Work with NERSC staff and code teams to transition and optimize simulation, data analytics, or machine learning codes for the Perlmutter system in performance-portable ways.

Do you want to get in at the ground level of an early-stage startup that already has a highly talented team and lots of customer traction and revenue? We’re transforming the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry with our AI platform that improves yield and lowers manufacturing costs at some of the largest chip makers in the world. We’re looking for machine learning engineers who are interested in implementing, improving, and scaling new and existing algorithms using open source machine learning libraries/frameworks or writing one from scratch. We look for some combination of: high creativity and productivity, depth and breadth of knowledge in the field, and the ability to implement and scale up state of the art and/or unproven algorithms. You’ll work closely with other data scientists and software engineers to implement feature engineering, data transformations, and machine learning algorithms from scripting languages to high performance code that can scale. We look for people who are self-motivated and passionate about the transformative potential of AI. This position presents an exciting and unique opportunity to design/build the product and the platform from scratch utilizing high performance machine learning algorithms, data science and the associated frameworks.  StreamMosaic is a VC-funded startup in downtown San Jose.  Responsibilities:  Implementing scalable ML algorithms in production Improving computational performance of ML algorithms Interact with App Developers and Data Scientists to create clean API interfaces Requirements  MS or PhD in Computer Science, OR, EE, Physics or related quantitative field 3+ years of engineering experience with significant exposure to algorithm implementation/machine learning libraries/frameworks Ability to analyze the bottlenecks and create high performance code Good understanding of CPU and memory issues in parallel computing Job Details  This work involves building robust ML models to achieve desired accuracy on metrics of customer interest (e.g. yield, tolerance). Broken into steps, the work is roughly an equal mix of tweaking core ML algorithms for enhanced performance and creating deployment-ready software.  This role offers a unique opportunity to deploy non-trivial ML models into production and seeing the impact of those models in action at some of the world’s largest chip manufacturers. This is not a Hadoop/Spark-focused big data role but rather an ML-focused role. Our deployment environment is markedly different from typical cloud deployment with constant access for updates or bug-fixes. Roughly stated, the production requirements are closer to a self-driving robot than a cloud-integrated image recognition service.  An ideal candidate has invested time in continuous learning and implementing algorithms either using an existing framework/library or from scratch and understands failure modes of various algorithms in production. Additionally, the ideal candidate has collaborated with Data Scientists to put ML code into production.  Location  South San Francisco Bay Area</td>\n",

       "1368  Machine Learning Engineer email us at jobs@streammosaic.com  Description Are you looking to make a big impact and write code from scratch, not just supporting old legacy code? Do you want to get in at the ground level of an early-stage startup that already has a highly talented team and lots of customer traction and revenue? We’re transforming the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry with our AI platform that improves yield and lowers manufacturing costs at some of the largest chip makers in the world. We’re looking for machine learning engineers who are interested in implementing, improving, and scaling new and existing algorithms using open source machine learning libraries/frameworks or writing one from scratch. We look for some combination of: high creativity and productivity, depth and breadth of knowledge in the field, and the ability to implement and scale up state of the art and/or unproven algorithms. You’ll work closely with other data scientists and software engineers to implement feature engineering, data transformations, and machine learning algorithms from scripting languages to high performance code that can scale. We look for people who are self-motivated and passionate about the transformative potential of AI. This position presents an exciting and unique opportunity to design/build the product and the platform from scratch utilizing high performance machine learning algorithms, data science and the associated frameworks.  StreamMosaic is a VC-funded startup in downtown San Jose.  Responsibilities:  Implementing scalable ML algorithms in production Improving computational performance of ML algorithms Interact with App Developers and Data Scientists to create clean API interfaces Requirements  MS or PhD in Computer Science, OR, EE, Physics or related quantitative field 3+ years of engineering experience with significant exposure to algorithm implementation/machine learning libraries/frameworks Ability to analyze the bottlenecks and create high performance code Good understanding of CPU and memory issues in parallel computing Job Details  This work involves building robust ML models to achieve desired accuracy on metrics of customer interest (e.g. yield, tolerance). Broken into steps, the work is roughly an equal mix of tweaking core ML algorithms for enhanced performance and creating deployment-ready software.  This role offers a unique opportunity to deploy non-trivial ML models into production and seeing the impact of those models in action at some of the world’s largest chip manufacturers. This is not a Hadoop/Spark-focused big data role but rather an ML-focused role. Our deployment environment is markedly different from typical cloud deployment with constant access for updates or bug-fixes. Roughly stated, the production requirements are closer to a self-driving robot than a cloud-integrated image recognition service.  An ideal candidate has invested time in continuous learning and implementing algorithms either using an existing framework/library or from scratch and understands failure modes of various algorithms in production. Additionally, the ideal candidate has collaborated with Data Scientists to put ML code into production.

    "### This is very interesting.  What we can see here is that a job description from a relatively balanced field has the greatest distance from the very-male dominated field.  While the NLP and Pattern Recognition aren't as far apart as the Deep Learning and Pattern Recognition, I think it is still of note.  What we see here is that a job description from a balanced field is different from one that is not balanced at all.  This makes a great case that even job descriptions that might be skewed toward one gender or another are more similar than we realize as well.  \n",
