       "      <td>Machine learning is a key initiative for Overstock as we strive to help our customers find great deals on furniture, décor, and other items to make every home a dream home.  We’re looking for a sharp software developer to bring your expertise designing and implementing scalable production systems to our machine learning team. You’ll learn real-world machine learning techniques from PhDs and experts in the field while ensuring we can deploy sophisticated model predictions to millions of users in real time. (Looking for a pure ML/data science position? Try our Machine Learning Scientist role.)  You’ll work on problems like recommender systems, search ranking, and personalization. You’ll build frameworks, webservices, and data pipelines for mature production machine learning systems. Sometimes you’ll be the one training the model and sometimes you’ll work with a crack Machine Learning Scientist who’s in that role. We work in Python, Scala, and Java and use technologies including Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, Vowpal Wabbit, Docker, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Redis, Hadoop, and GCP—we move fast and we’re always evaluating cutting-edge tech.  Some things you might want to know about our environment: We have millions of pageviews a day, millions of customers, millions of products, a wide range of ecommerce functionality, terabytes of data to work with, and 20 years of success to build on  W e need you to be a technical leader who helps us build the right architecture and adopt good development practices tailored to the specific challenges of ML .  We’re a learning culture. As a team we incrementally gain knowledge of a problem through ML experiments, and as professionals we incrementally gain mastery of the field through real-world projects. Instead of divvying up every piece of a project to someone who’s already an expert in that skillset, we expect and enable people to own larger chunks of projects, learn from each other, and grow where they have existing gaps.  It’s not uncommon for a single developer to own every aspect of a projec t or sub-system . That means playing with data and open source libraries or existing in-house components, figuring out what you don’t know and tracking down answers, and writing multiple software components that might include a model training job, data pipelines, data stores, and a webservice to expose predictions to an external team.  We use Slack, pull requests, and videoconferencing or in-person interactions to help each other out whether we’re working on the same project or not .  We have a squad-based team structure, where people working on related problems attend standup together and design system architecture jointly, but instead of being on a formal team we have the option to create squads including people from multiple teams and to let people easily shift to new problem domains.  We’re a couple years into a DevOps transition—our webservices use a CI/CD paradigm, all new projects are in Docker, and we enjoy a lot of autonomy in new tech adoption .  We’re laidback! We have good work-life balance , flexible hours, and work-from-home opportunities . We enjoy team activities and chatting about non-work-related hobbies and interests .  Machine learning is a high priority for Overstock now as we strive to help our customers find great deals on furniture, décor, and other items to make every home a dream home. Your work will be valued and supported .  Does this sound like a good fit for you?

       "1402  Machine learning is a key initiative for Overstock as we strive to help our customers find great deals on furniture, décor, and other items to make every home a dream home.  We’re looking for a sharp software developer to bring your expertise designing and implementing scalable production systems to our machine learning team. You’ll learn real-world machine learning techniques from PhDs and experts in the field while ensuring we can deploy sophisticated model predictions to millions of users in real time. (Looking for a pure ML/data science position? Try our Machine Learning Scientist role.)  You’ll work on problems like recommender systems, search ranking, and personalization. You’ll build frameworks, webservices, and data pipelines for mature production machine learning systems. Sometimes you’ll be the one training the model and sometimes you’ll work with a crack Machine Learning Scientist who’s in that role. We work in Python, Scala, and Java and use technologies including Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, Vowpal Wabbit, Docker, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Redis, Hadoop, and GCP—we move fast and we’re always evaluating cutting-edge tech.  Some things you might want to know about our environment: We have millions of pageviews a day, millions of customers, millions of products, a wide range of ecommerce functionality, terabytes of data to work with, and 20 years of success to build on  W e need you to be a technical leader who helps us build the right architecture and adopt good development practices tailored to the specific challenges of ML .  We’re a learning culture. As a team we incrementally gain knowledge of a problem through ML experiments, and as professionals we incrementally gain mastery of the field through real-world projects. Instead of divvying up every piece of a project to someone who’s already an expert in that skillset, we expect and enable people to own larger chunks of projects, learn from each other, and grow where they have existing gaps.  It’s not uncommon for a single developer to own every aspect of a projec t or sub-system . That means playing with data and open source libraries or existing in-house components, figuring out what you don’t know and tracking down answers, and writing multiple software components that might include a model training job, data pipelines, data stores, and a webservice to expose predictions to an external team.  We use Slack, pull requests, and videoconferencing or in-person interactions to help each other out whether we’re working on the same project or not .  We have a squad-based team structure, where people working on related problems attend standup together and design system architecture jointly, but instead of being on a formal team we have the option to create squads including people from multiple teams and to let people easily shift to new problem domains.  We’re a couple years into a DevOps transition—our webservices use a CI/CD paradigm, all new projects are in Docker, and we enjoy a lot of autonomy in new tech adoption .  We’re laidback! We have good work-life balance , flexible hours, and work-from-home opportunities . We enjoy team activities and chatting about non-work-related hobbies and interests .  Machine learning is a high priority for Overstock now as we strive to help our customers find great deals on furniture, décor, and other items to make every home a dream home. Your work will be valued and supported .  Does this sound like a good fit for you?

       "2816  In Cognition people—not technology—are at the center of everything we do. Our technology moves beyond traditional computing devices in creating a new way of interacting that will bring us closer together—whether that’s students “meeting” on the surface of a virtual Mars, a grandparent attending a birthday party from another country, or a Doctor removing a tumor inside a human body. We work on the most advanced and groundbreaking technologies from speech recognition, natural language processing, conversational AI, computer vision, deep learning, hardware, systems software to 3D graphics. Our work enables speech and vision experiences across PCs, XBOX, Office products, Hololens, Mixed Reality and IOT devices.

The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people's lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.  CX Social is a distributed system that is high-volume and soft-realtime. Our infrastructure spans multiple data centers and is made up of over a hundred servers. This goes hand in hand with some challenges from an operations perspective. We need to be able to scale according to our needs. We need to monitor a ton of services and servers. As we deploy our code to production many times a day, we need deployment to run smooth and automated. Of course, we're totally buzzword-compliant with agile, docker, SaltStack and coffee breaks.  Our system engineers have 2+ years of experience and a passion for development. Our product is a web application, so our main software stack has the usual parts like PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Memcached, Redis, and Node.js. There are some more exotic things in there as well, like Clojure, ReactJS, Vowpal Wabbit, and others. Knowledge of any or all of these technologies is a huge plus, as is experience with deploying and scaling them, and server management.  We use continuous integration and our app is deployed by everyone in the team, multiple times a day. This means, that as a system engineer, you work together with the rest of the development team to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you know a thing or two about monitoring, security, Service Oriented Architecture or CAP theorem, come talk to us about it!

       "1862  Below is a snapshot of our Systems Engineer / DevOps role within our Product Engineering Operations team. If this role takes your fancy and you are in interested in a career at Clarabridge please apply here and let's chat - we are always keen to speak to highly talented and passionate people!  The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people's lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.  CX Social is a distributed system that is high-volume and soft-realtime. Our infrastructure spans multiple data centers and is made up of over a hundred servers. This goes hand in hand with some challenges from an operations perspective. We need to be able to scale according to our needs. We need to monitor a ton of services and servers. As we deploy our code to production many times a day, we need deployment to run smooth and automated. Of course, we're totally buzzword-compliant with agile, docker, SaltStack and coffee breaks.  Our system engineers have 2+ years of experience and a passion for development. Our product is a web application, so our main software stack has the usual parts like PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Memcached, Redis, and Node.js. There are some more exotic things in there as well, like Clojure, ReactJS, Vowpal Wabbit, and others. Knowledge of any or all of these technologies is a huge plus, as is experience with deploying and scaling them, and server management.  We use continuous integration and our app is deployed by everyone in the team, multiple times a day. This means, that as a system engineer, you work together with the rest of the development team to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you know a thing or two about monitoring, security, Service Oriented Architecture or CAP theorem, come talk to us about it! We'd love to hear your opinions.  ------  ------  About Clarabridge  Clarabridge helps hundreds of the world's leading brands understand and improve their customer experience.

    "Exploring data will occupy the largest portion of attention, and should be second nature in order to deeply understand the phenomenon being modeled, and the validity and reliability of the inputs, including but not limited to inspecting univariate distributions, exploring bivariate relationships, constructing appropriate transformations, and tracking down the source and meaning of anomalies when and where they arise.\n",
    "Model building should draw from any approach that enhances accuracy and understanding including statistical modeling, mathematical modeling, network modeling, social network modeling, natural language processing, machine learning, algorithms, genetic algorithms, and neural networks.\n",
    "Validating models against alternative approaches, expected and observed outcome, and numerous directly and indirectly relevant business defined key performance indicators.\n",
    "Reviewing models of peers for the purpose of reducing and managing risk to the business, and maximizing improvement of business practice and customer experience.\n",
    "Implementing models from the initial evaluation of the computational demands, accuracy, and reliability of the relevant ETL processes, and the integrity of the data sources in production, to the computational demands, accuracy, and reliability of the simpler scoring processes, to the computational demands, accuracy, and reliability of model training in higher and higher frequencies in the production environment.\n",
    "Operationalization will include identifying the stakeholders in the life of a model score throughout the company and around the world, forming trusting bonds, understanding the phenomenon, optimizing the model output for integration to the practice, assuring “buy in” from practitioners as well as leaders, training for proper utilization and communication, and assessing proper utilization.\n",
    "Model management will include developing sustainable, consumable, accurate, and impactful reporting on model inputs, model outputs, observed outputs, business impact, and key performance indicators.\n",
    "Data scientists must be able to discuss their research in any level of detail with their peers, and with appropriate calibration to stakeholders in small and large group settings. They are expected to acquire support and partnership from personalities through the company, including engineering and research teams at Amazon globally. Successful data scientists are expected to influence and mentor each other, influence and mentor their peers globally, and influence and mentor their partners in the business in every country.'''"
