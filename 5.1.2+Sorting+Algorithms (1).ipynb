When you get a hand of cards in a game you want to organize them is some kind of reasonable fashion. This makes it easier to know what cards are in your hand, and to find and access the cards you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are many different ways to sort. Everyone kind of has their own method. Some will pick cards up one and a time and sequence them as they go. Others will move through their hand reorganizing card by card. You could even just randomly shuffle them again and again until they are sorted (though this would not be a very efficient approach). Different methods work best in different games and with different sized hands. These same general concepts apply to sorting lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of our lists will have a set of values, in our case integers ranging from 0 to 1,000,000. Our goal is to return this list ordered from smallest to largest in the least amount of time. In situations where there are duplicates, those duplicates will maintain their original order (this preserves _stability_ in our algorithm). Our goal is to sort the list as efficiently as possible. This will be _measured_ in runtime, but also _discussed_ in terms of steps."

To add elements to that list, we take an element from our original list and then move through our new list, stopping and inserting it in the appropriate place. We do this by placing it in the position ahead of the first element in the new list that is larger than our chosen element. If none are larger then it is added to the end.\n",

This means computation can get more intensive quite quickly, as evidenced by the runtime of our long list. Think about what a square function looks like if you graph it. It grows at an ever increasing rate.

    "## Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for improving this is to use a _merge sort_. Merge sort takes advantage of fact that merging two small sorted lists into one large sorted list is fast. Merge sort starts by breaking our large list into single element sublists. It's a bit wonky, but if you think about it these single-element lists are each inherently ordered. Then we merge those single-element lists together into ordered pairs, reading from a single end to preserve their order. We repeat this process and arrive ultimately at a sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will look much more complex in code but the concept is easier to understand with an example. Let's try it first with a very basic manual walkthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our list were `[3, 7, 2, 4]` The algorithm would first break it up into four pieces `[3], [7], [2], [4]`. Then we could split that into two groups and merge each by order, resulting in `[3, 7], [2, 4]`. Finally we bring those two lists together to get `[2, 3, 4, 7]`. It's more efficient because in any merge we only have to look at the leading entry from each prior list. For that final merge in the first step we're only comparing 3 to 2 and 4 to 7, since we already know 4 and 7 are larger than their prior entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does that give us an advantage? It's because we won't have to handle large unordered data. We always know what's next in any merge is from one of two places (the next element in each of our two lists we're merging). It's over really long lists that this advantage becomes decidedly worthwhile. This technique is called _divide and conquer_. Our insertion sort tries to solve the whole problem in one piece. Sometimes that's great. But in the case of sorting a long list, that process is inefficient. By breaking our task into smaller ones, in this case sorting small lists and then merging those ordered lists together, we make significant gains in efficiency. Here's a bigger example.\n",
