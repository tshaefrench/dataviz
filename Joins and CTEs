What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
SELECT 
	trips.duration,
	weather.Events
FROM 
	trips
JOIN 
	weather 
ON
	trips.zip_code = weather.ZIP
WHERE 
	weather.Events = 'Rain' 
ORDER BY
	trips.duration DESC 
LIMIT 3

Which station is full most often? San Jose Diridon Caltrain Station 

SELECT 
	stations.station_id,
	stations.name,
	stations.dockcount,
	status.docks_available,
	status.bikes_available
FROM 
	stations
JOIN 
	status
ON 
	stations.station_id = status.station_id
WHERE 
	docks_available = 0
GROUP BY
	stations.station_id
LIMIT 
1;

Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT 
	start_station,
	dockcount,
	COUNT(*)
FROM 
	trips
JOIN 
	stations
ON 
stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2 DESC

JOIN

ON
	trips.zip_code=weather.ZIP
